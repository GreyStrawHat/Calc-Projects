# Instructions:
- Create implementations for each of the header files in the "include" directory and place them in the "src" directory.
- You should not have to modify any of the files in the tests directory or the CMakeLists.txt, but if you identify problems with either, make an issue on your repo.
- The tests are still in development. If you reach this section before it gets updated in the master branch of your repo, reach out to someone at CSD-T to see if they have been completed yet.
